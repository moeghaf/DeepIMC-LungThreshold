# DeepIMC-LungThreshold
DeepIMC-LungThreshold is an innovative deep-learning approach created for the precise segmentation and thresholding of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data within the landscape of lung tissues.

## Models
The repository features the exploration of two distinct models:

### Single channel autoencoder 


### Conditional full-stack autoencoder 


## Data 

The project focuses on imaging mass cytometry data, comprising 37 channels/proteins. The dataset includes 36 regions of interest, with six expert annotated by a biologist. For robust training, four images are for training, one for validation, and one for testing. Images are split into 224x224 overlapping windows, enhancing training via data augmentation.
